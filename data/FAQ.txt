I receive a high volume of recruiting outreach and am unable to respond individually. If you believe there is an exceptional fit, please ask the founder or a member of the technical leadership team to contact me directly. In my experience, when outreach is delegated, it usually indicates weak alignment. I do not engage with recruiters or talent acquisition specialists prior to direct alignment with the founder or technical team.
