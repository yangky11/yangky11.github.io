Kaiyu Yang is a postdoctoral scholar at Caltech, working with Prof. Anima Anandkumar. His research aims to make machine learning capable of symbolic reasoning. It includes (1) applying machine learning to symbolic reasoning tasks, such as automated theorem proving; and (2) introducing symbolic components into machine learning models to make them more interpretable, verifiable, and data-efficient. In addition, he has also worked on constructing and analyzing machine learning datasets, especially focusing on fairness, privacy, and mitigating dataset bias. His research is recognized with a Siebel Scholar award. Before joining Caltech, he received his Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science at Princeton University, advised by Prof. Jia Deng.
